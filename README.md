<h1 align="center">remnant (squabble up)</h1>

# attention
After some time and stuff, genuinely no hate to pathos, he took it like a man and didn't grow out the beef any further. <br>
I respect it, he did not exit scam and eventually came back.

# explanation

Please just save up and buy a proper protection tool instead of letting random people handle obfuscation. <br>
And.. maybe don't throw stones from a glass house :sob:

To everyone else, don't cheap out on protection, might take longer to save up for it but it is worth it. <br>
No disrespect to the other developers of remnant, we love y'all :hearts: <br>
Also no hate to polymorphism itself, it's not exactly good but I don't have anything against them personally.
